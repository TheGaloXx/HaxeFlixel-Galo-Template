 My own template for HaxeFlixel.

How to use:
1. Open a CMD in the folder you want the game to be in.
2. Type ```haxe flixel tpl galo "THE NAME OF YOUR GAME"``` and press ENTER.
3. It should have created a folder with your game's name. Open it.
4. Edit the ```project.xml``` file as you want.
5. Change the ```haxe appTitle``` variable to your game's name.
